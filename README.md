## 🚀 Problem Statement

Mr. X owns a large strip of land on Mars and can build three types of properties:

| Property | Build Time | Earnings/Unit | Land Space |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Theatre (T) | 5 units | $1500 | 2x1 |
| Pub (P) | 4 units | $1000 | 1x1 |
| Commercial Park (C) | 10 units | $2000 | 3x1 |

**Objective:** Find the optimal mix of properties to maximize earnings within n time units.

## 📊 Test Cases

✅ **Test Case 1:** n=7 → Expected Earnings: $3000  
✅ **Test Case 2:** n=8 → Expected Earnings: $4500  
✅ **Test Case 3:** n=13 → Expected Earnings: $16500  

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Page structure
- **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Dynamic calculations and interactivity
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` - Complete web application (single file)
- `app.py` - Python Streamlit version (optional)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Documentation

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Input Phase:** User enters the number of time units available
2. **Calculation Phase:** Algorithm explores all possible combinations
3. **Optimization:** Identifies the combination(s) with maximum earnings
4. **Display Phase:** Shows results with detailed breakdown

## 💡 Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n³) - Three nested loops through combinations
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only stores the best solution(s)

## 🌐 Deployment (GitHub Pages - FREE)

This application is deployed for free using GitHub Pages:

1. Push HTML/CSS/JS files to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in Settings > Pages
3. Select "main" branch as source
4. Site is automatically deployed to: `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

**No servers, no costs, no hassle!**
